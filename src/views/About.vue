        <b>Ibrahim</b> started selling chendol at Haig Road Market and was roped into this business to help his family at a young age. This has allowed Ibrahim to establish friendly relationships with fellow hawkers. Ibrahim was always looking out for ways to use technology to give the entire community a leverage and push so that more customers can attempt his fellow hawker friends’ dishes!
